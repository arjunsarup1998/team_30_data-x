Note: to get the .json files (aka, the media-metadata files) that we used as well as the images we ran object detection on, 
please go to the google drive links provided in our project writeup. We didn't upload that data to github because the total size is too large.
For the yolo files we used in your yolo ipynb, please feel free to go to the provided google drive links in the project writeup.
The instagram scraper provided in this repo is our modified version of the rarcega instagram scraper. It fetches the top 10 comments for each post.
Feel free to email us if you have trouble fetching any of the required data from google drive.
